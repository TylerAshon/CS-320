How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure your code, program, or software is functional and secure, conduct thorough testing, including unit, integration, and security testing. Follow best practices like input validation, encryption, and secure authentication while keeping dependencies up to date.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs involves gathering requirements through surveys, interviews, or feedback and translating them into technical specifications. Prioritize user experience (UX) and iterate on designs based on real-world usage and testing.

How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, start with clear objectives and a well-defined architecture using design patterns suited to the project. Consider scalability, maintainability, and security from the beginning while using an iterative development process.
